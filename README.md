# NodeServer

This is a little project for a job application. The theme is a feature request webapp for interdepartmental usage.

There will be a clientside webapp with javascript for data validation and dynamic form creation

There will be a Node.js server on the backend taking that information and interacting with a DB

There will be an SQL DB that stores all of the information collected and can be refferenced.
